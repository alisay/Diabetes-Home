            Everyone knows that diabetes is hard to manage. One of the hardest part is keeping track of your blood
            glucose and insulin intake every day. This website is built for you to make this process easier, so you
            can spend more time doing what you love and less time managing your diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major advantage of using our website is that your doctor has a direct link to your daily
            information, so they can get in contact with you if something is wrong.

            Making Diabetes Management Fun!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Let’s be honest - diabetes isn’t fun to have. But we can make managing it fun! So we have put together a
            point and scoring system that keeps track of how many times you input your health data. The more consecutive
            days you upload your data, the better you’ll do! Have fun!
